# Using Combinatorics to Understand Planning Complexity in Project Teams

## Problem Context
In project environments, managers often need to assign tasks, form teams, or plan execution sequences under constraints. 
This project demonstrates how combinatorics helps quantify planning complexity.

## Scenario Description
A project consists of 5 tasks and 3 team members. 
Different task orders and groupings lead to different execution outcomes.

## Permutations (Order Matters)
Executing 3 tasks in sequence:
3! = 6 possible execution orders.

## Variations (Selection + Order)
Selecting 2 tasks from 5 where order matters:
V(5,2) = 20 possible outcomes.

## Combinations (Selection Only)
Selecting 3 tasks from 5 regardless of order:
C(5,3) = 10 possible groups.

## Key Insights
- Planning complexity grows rapidly
- Order increases risk and coordination effort
- Structured planning reduces decision overload

## Next Steps
Probability will be used to evaluate likelihood of outcomes.
